<strong><h3>Tuesday (01-11-2022)</h3></strong>

1. Watch [this][1] video about compilation and interpretation.

    ```
    Done
    ```

2. Search and answer the question: Java language is compiled or interpreted?

    ```
    The Java language is a hybrid language, this is because the source code is first compiled into bytecode wich is a special binary code generated by the Java compiler and this intermediate language is interpreted and executed by the Java virtual machine.
    ```

3. Create an algorithm to calculate the equivalent of your local currencty to USDinterpretation.

    ```
    #Dollar to Quetzal
    - Define the equivalent of one dollar in quetzals.
    - Enter the value in quetzals to be converted.
    - Divide the quetzals by the equivalent of one dollar.
    - Show how many dollars are the entered amount.
    ```

4. Read about Pseudocode [here][2], you can also find some examples [here][3].

    ```
    Done
    ```

5. Anwser to the question: Why is pseudocode helpful?

    ```
    Because you just have to be able to explain what you're thinking and doing. You make the rules yourself.
    ```

6. Create a pseudocode to calculate the aproximated age of a user base on the year they born, (you can define a variable with the actual year if you need it, like for example i could define Y <-- 2022).

    ```
    Starting point: START
    Input: GET
    Output: PRINT
    End point: END

    START
    YearBorn <--- GET
    ActualYear <--- GET
    Age <--- ActualYear - YearBorn
    PRINT Age
    END
    ```

7. Read about flowcharts [here][4].

    ```
    Done
    ```

8. Answer to the question: Why are flowcharts important to us as developers?

    ```
    Flowcharts allow us to explain in more detail the logic of the program, show how the code is organized, visualize the flow of execution or operation that the program can have.
    ```

9. Search about High-level languages and Low-level languages, you can start with [this][5] video.

    ```
    Done
    ```

<strong><h3>Wednesday (01-12-2022)</h3></strong>

1. Learn about binary, decimal and hexadecimal numbers.

    ```
    Done
    ```

2. Translate the year you where born to binary, decimal and hexadecimal.

    ```
    - Decimal: 1996
    - Binary: 11111001100
    - Hexadecimal: 7CC
    ```

3. Translate 51966 into hexadecimal and binary.

    ```
    - Binary: 1100101011111110
    - Hexadecimal: CAFE
    ```

4. Use a Low-level language, for example MIPS assembler, to do so, you will need to follow [this][6] guide. We recommend to check the guide first but also [this][7] presentation could be helpful.

    ```
    Done
    ```

5. Base on the examples and the guide of the low-level language: 
    1. [Create a program to add two numbers given by the user.](./src/Program1.asm)
    2. [Create a program that display your name.](./src/Program2.asm)

        ```
        Done
        ```
