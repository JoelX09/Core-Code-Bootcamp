```
public static String monthNames[] = {"January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"};

A class method is an instance method of the class object. When a new class is created, an object of type `Class` is initialized and assigned to a global constant (Mobile in this case).

```java
public static String monthNames[] = {"January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"};
```
