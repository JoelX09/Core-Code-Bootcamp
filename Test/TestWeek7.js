// Implement the "findSmallestInterval(numbers)" function which returns the smallest positive 
// interval between two values of the "numbers" table.

// For example given the table "[1, 6, 4, 8, 2]" the smallest interval is "1" 
// (difference between "2" and "1")

// Constraints:
// "numbers" contains at least two numbers and a maximun of 100,000 entries.

// The solution which favor execution time on large size arrays will get the most points.

// The difference between two elements will never exceed the size of an integer for your language.
